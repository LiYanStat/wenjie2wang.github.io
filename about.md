title: About

I established this site mainly to push myself to learn more. I would like to
summarize something I learned on statistics, programming, and Linux commands,
etc. into <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/notes">notes</a> so that I could review and
refer to later. I would be glad if it turns out to be of help to others as
well. However, everything posted here is just my personal point of view and
subject to updates and any possible correction.  So for your own sake, please do
not take everything for granted.


Technically, this site is powered by [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The layouts are constructed based
on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme with minor customization.
