title: Five Things on Editing BibTeX Files We Should Keep in Mind
---

## 1. Type of BibTeX entry

Usually, it is *article* or *book*.  However, many other options are avaiable,
such as *phdthesis* for a Ph.D. thesis, *inproceedings* for an article in a
conference proceeding, and *manual* for technical documentation.  We should
always check whether the type of BibTeX entry is correct at first.

## 2. Format of author or editor names

Each name consists of possible four components:

+ *First name* (including middle names provided and followed)
+ *von* (*de la* or *van der*, etc.)
+ *Last name* (surname excluding *von*)
+ *Jr* (Junior)

BibTeX recognizes each name in one of the following formats:

+ *First von Last*
+ *von Last, First*
+ *von Last, Junior, First*

Names are recognized by the deliminator word *and*.

## 3. Capitalization of titles

We should always capitalize titles and let the bibliography style do its job for
the output.  Generally, we do not capitalize:

+ Articles: *a*, *an*, *the*
+ Coordinating Conjunctions: *and*, *but*, *or*, *for*, *nor*, etc.
+ Prepositions fewer than five letters: *on*, *at*, *to*, *from*, *by*, etc.

However, any word after colon should be capitalized and protected by **{}** in
title.

## 4. Two dashes between page numbers

For example, we should have **pages = {397--405}** instead of **pages = {397-405}**
in *pages* field.

## 5. Protect special words

We should protect some special words from the bibliography style.  For instance,
the initials of **{B}ayesian**, **{M}arkov**, **{G}aussian** should always be
protected by **{}**; while the whole word **{MCMC}** should be protected completely.
