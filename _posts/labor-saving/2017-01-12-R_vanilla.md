title: Make Option "--vanilla" Default for All R Sessions

## Motivation

It is usually recommended not to save the workspace every time when we quit an
**R** session so that no workspace will be automatically loaded next time. It
prevents potential problem especially when someone is unaware of that the
previous workspace is loaded automatically in the current **R** session.  It
also speeds up the initialization of **R** without loading possibly large
`.RData` file. Without any customization, **R** will ask whether we would like
to save the workspace whenever we try to close it, which can be really annoying.
All the trouble can be avoided by turning on the option `--vanilla`.


## Option `--vanilla`

From `man R`, the option `--vanilla` is a combined option of `--no-save`,
`--no-restore`, `--no-site-file`, `--no-init-file`, and `--no-environ` for a
vanilla environment.


## Make option `--vanilla` default

+ We may add an alias of `R` in `.bashrc` so that the **R** session called in
  terminal or Rstudio will actually have `--vanilla` turned on by default.

```
alias R="$(/usr/bin/which R) --vanilla"
```

It is easy to verify whether the alias does the trick (after `source
~/.bashrc`). Just start a new `R` session in the terminal by entering `R` and
type `q()` to quit. If **R** does not ask whether you would like to save the
workspace, you were actually using `R --vanilla`.


+ For [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/) users, we may customize the `R` argument
  by `M-x customize-variable`, `inferior-R-args`, and setting it to be
  `--vanilla`. Or put the following sample configure into `.custom.el` directly
  inside the `custom-set-variables` as follows:

```lisp
(custom-set-variables
;; other customization
'(inferior-R-args "--vanilla")
)
```

Similarly, we may verify whether the customization works by `q()`.
