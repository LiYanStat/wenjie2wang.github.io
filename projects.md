+ R packages I have been developing and maintaining

    + [*reda*](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/reda) for *r*ecurrent *e*vent
      *d*ata *a*nalysis. Functions that fit gamma frailty model with spline or
      piecewise constant baseline rate function for recurrent event data,
      compute and plot parametric mean cumulative function (MCF) from a fitted
      model as well as nonparametric sample MCF (Nelson-Aalen estimator) are
      provided.  Most functions are S4 methods that produce S4 class objects.

    + [*dynsurv*](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/dynsurv) fitting time-varying
      coefficient models for interval censored survival data using Bayesian
      dynamic Cox model

    + [*splines2*](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/splines2): A complementary
      package on splines providing functions constructing B-spline, monotone
      spline (M-spline) and its integral (I-spline), convex spline (C-spline),
      and integral of B-spline basis.  Piecewise constant basis is allowed for
      B-spline and M-spline basis.
