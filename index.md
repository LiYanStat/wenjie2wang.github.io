## Welcome

I have been pursuing my Ph.D. degree in statistics
at [University of Connecticut][uconn] since Fall 2014.  I earned my B.S. degree
in Statistics and an outstanding graduate award at [Tongji University][tongji],
Shanghai, China in 2014.

I like statistical thinking and have great enthusiasm for programming, mostly
in [R][r].  Consequently, I have been developing and maintaining a few R
packages and code for some statistical <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects">projects</a>.  I believe it is really an
exciting and challenging world for statisticians and/or data scientists.

I enjoy using [Emacs][emacs] and [Arch Linux][archlinux] every day.  I would
like to contribute more to open source efforts as I learn more.

Sitting and coding in front of monitor all day long is definitely not the life
style I want to have. So I cook for myself almost every day and do physical
workouts every other day to stay away from my laptop for a couple of hours.

One of my favorite statistical concepts is martingale learned from probability
theory since

> In a sense life itself is a martingale.

Formulated by the Nobel Prize laureate of 2002, Imre Kertâ€Œ&#233;sz, in his book
*Ad kudarc* with the Swedish title *Fiasko*:

> It is not the future that is expecting me, just the next moment, the future
> does not exist, it is nothing but a perpetual ongoing, a present now. The
> prediction for my future---is the quality of my present.
