## Welcome

I am trying hard pursuing my Ph.D. degree in statistics at University of
Connecticut currently.

I like statistical thinking and have great enthusiasm for
programming, mostly in [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
Consequently, I have been developing and maintaining several R packages and
code for some statistical <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects">projects</a>.
I believe it is really an exciting and challenging world for statisticians
and/or data scientists.

I enjoy using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
and [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) every day.
I would like to contribute more to open source efforts as I learn more.

One of my favorite statistical concepts is martingale learned from probability
theory since

> In a sense life itself is a martingale.

Formulated by the Nobel Prize laureate of 2002, Imre Kertâ€Œ&#233;sz, in his book
*Ad kudarc* with the Swedish title *Fiasko*:

> It is not the future that is expecting me, just the next moment, the future
> does not exist, it is nothing but a perpetual ongoing, a present now. The
> prediction for my future---is the quality of my present.
